If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Average Energy = 0.65906
Average Valence = 0.484443
Average Danceability = 0.71646

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
 What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
First categorize all songs into three groups(energy, valence,danceability).
Then calculate the average for energy, valence, danceability according groups.
This averages accurately reflect listener preference.
