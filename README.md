# ​ CS50x-2024-Coursework – Abisegan Sirirangangathan

This repository showcases my personal work in **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science (2024)**.  
It includes all **problem sets** and my **final project**, structured by week with integrated challenges.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
These solutions are entirely **my own work**, and are shared publicly **for educational and portfolio purposes only**.  
If you're currently enrolled in CS50, please **avoid copying or submitting** this code.  
Always attempt the problems on your own first—this is where lasting learning happens.
